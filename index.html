                    From inception our classes were designed to bring the benefits of traditional instructor-led
                    training to the internet, bundled with live Q & A, labs, study guides, mentors and offline
                    training options. Today we deliver a training experience that is more effective for skill
                    development and certification prep than anything on the market.
                    <br>
                    Our instructors underpin every mode of learning in the offering, from providing subject-matter
                    expertise during development and professional classroom presentation, to the delivery of
                    mentoring, class notes, and study guides.

                    Descriptive Paragraph <br>
                    1. Describe: I am going to DESCRIBE a sunset!
                    <br>
                    Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink,
                    and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun
                    moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in
                    prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds
                    that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.

                    Informational Paragraph and a Narrative Paragraph
                    2. Inform: I am going to INFORM you about the Apollo 11 space mission.
                    <br>
                    On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
                    Its mission was to go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil
                    Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of
                    Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following
                    day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar
                    Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He declared, “That’s one small
                    step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human history!
                    <br>
                    Narrate: I am going to NARRATE a story about the Apollo 11 space mission.
                    <br>
                    It was July 21, 1969, and Neil Armstrong awoke with a start. It was the day he would become the
                    first human being to ever walk on the moon. The journey had begun several days earlier, when on
                    July 16th, the Apollo 11 launched from Earth headed into outer space. On board with Neil
                    Armstrong were Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. The crew landed on the moon in the Sea of
                    Tranquility a day before the actual walk. Upon Neil’s first step onto the moon’s surface, he
                    declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It sure was!
